Now lower your arms and shake them gently to shake out the tension. Gently stretch any areas that feel especially tense. When you are ready to proceed with your walk, go ahead and begin. Walk at whatever pace is comfortable for you- Not too slow… but not rushing either. Walk comfortably. Focus your attention on the rhythm of your steps: Left foot… right foot… left… right…. Allow this rhythm to sooth and relax you. Continue on this relaxing walk. Enjoy the movement of your body. Feel your body becoming energized as your muscles move. Feel your limbs moving. You can meditate as you walk by focusing your attention again on your footsteps. Count your steps as each foot touches the ground: One, two, three, four. one, two, three, four. one, two, three, four. one, two, three, four…. As your attention wanders, direct your focus again to your footsteps… one, two, three, four…. Continue to focus on your footsteps. Feel your energy increase with each step When each foot touches the ground. feel the energy rising all the way from your feet up through your legs… your hips… body… arms… all the way to the top of your head. The slight vibration when your foot lands on the ground serves to increase your relaxation and help you feel calm and energized. Your legs feel strong, supporting the weight of your body. Notice the slight weight shifts that allow you to walk From heel to the front of your foot and then transferring to the heel of the other foot, the front of that foot… back to the first foot…. notice these weight shifts. Notice the ever-repeating pattern of your steps. It is almost as if your feet are a wheel, rolling and rolling. One part contacts the earth while the other part is in the air. If time slowed down, you would notice that, almost imperceptibly, the weight shifts from one part of the wheel to the next, and the next and the next… until what was the bottom of the wheel is now the top. No part of the imaginary wheel… and no part of your feet… remains on the ground for long before transferring the weight to another part of your feet. Continuous motion. Continue the relaxing walk. The motion is very relaxing. Imagine the rhythm of your feet… it is like waves… flowing in and out… ever repeating…. Allow your breath to flow smoothly, also ever-repeating like waves… in… and out… in… out…. Hear the sounds of your footsteps. This is a calming and relaxing rhythm… just listening to this repeated beat. Notice all the repeated rhythms… footsteps… heartbeat… breathing… this smooth cycle of rhythms that allows you to proceed forward at a leisurely walk. Turn your attention now to your surroundings. Notice the environment around you… the surface you are walking on… the temperature… the colors… sounds… smells… enjoy your surroundings… enjoy this relaxing walk.

reflection,nan,"Take a moment to settle into a comfortable position. Notice now how you are feeling… how you are doing right now, in this moment. How does your body feel? Scan your body for a moment now, starting at your feet, simply noticing how your body is feeling. Notice your feet… ankles… legs… hips. Continue scanning your body, moving upward to your stomach, back, chest sides. Mentally. scan your hands, arms and shoulders… your neck, head and face. Where is your body the most tense? Where is your body the most relaxed? Just notice the state of tension and relaxation in your body. Notice how your body relaxes… bit by bit… without any effort on your part. See how your muscles become a little bit looser… less tense… naturally, just because you are taking a moment to sit quietly and relax, Without any effort or input from you… without you even trying… your body becoming slightly more relaxed with each passing moment. Think about your body image…. what is body image? Maybe you think about the picture in your mind you have of what your body looks like. Maybe it’s the ideas you have about your body… your feelings about your physical self. Perhaps body image is, is a vision of how you think your body should be. What does body image mean to you? Take a moment now to consider your thoughts and ideas about your own body. How are you feeling right now? thinking about your body image, You might feel neutral, content, comfortable, uncomfortable, satisfied, dissatisfied, happy or unhappy, angry, afraid, accepting… maybe a combination of things…. contradictory feelings are common… and it is okay to feel. however you are feeling. What might it be like to accept your body just as it is? What if you felt okay about your physical self? Imagine for a few moments what that would be like. Think about a time in your life when you felt accepting of your physical self – your whole self or even part of yourself. Which parts of your body are the easiest for you to accept? Imagine if you could accept your body as a whole rather than as a collection of individual parts. You have been doing some difficult thinking these last few moments. Let’s take a step back now mentally to relax. Breathe in deeply And breathe out. In… and out… In… and out… Keep breathing deeply, slowly. It feels good to take deep, calm breaths. Just relax for a moment while you notice your breathing. Just notice your breaths for a moment. If there are any areas where you are feeling tense, direct your attention to these areas as you breathe… imagining that each breath in brings relaxation… and each breath out expels tension. Breathing in relaxation… and breathing out tension… each breath relaxes you further. Now I will say some body image affirmations. You can repeat these if you wish, or simply relax as I talk. Each affirmation is true… even if it may not seem true right now. Let’s begin the affirmations. I am okay the way I am. I can accept myself the way I am. My body is acceptable just the way it is. I am an okay person. I accept this body I am in. There is no need to be perfect. My imperfections make me unique. I am perfectly alright just the way I am. My body is a functioning whole. I am human and all humans have flaws. I can accept my imperfections. I free myself from judging my body. I am okay just the way I am. I accept myself. Now that you have repeated some affirmations, take note of how you are feeling. What was it like to repeat or listen to the affirmations? It is okay to feel however you are feeling right now- good or bad. Accept the variety of feelings you may have. Take a moment now to just relax. Let all the worries and tension go as you breathe slowly. in… and out… in… out… continue to breathe, slowly, deeply… naturally, When you are ready to return to your waking level of consciousness, slowly leave this relaxed state you are in. Keep with you a feeling of calm, while becoming more awake and alert. Wake up your body and your mind, Move your arms and legs a little and feel your muscles reawakening. I’ll count up now from 5 to 1, and when I reach 1, you will be fully awake and ready to return to your usual activities. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1."

nan,nan,"This is justin michael williams, and welcome to your practice. Forgive yourself, Baby. just forgive yourself Every time we fall off track. what I really believe is that we're just being polished and refined and no matter how deep your spiritual practices or how strong are rooted in your values, in Your Vision, we all make mistakes, All of Us Fall Off Track- all of us- and I want you to know that it's okay. it really is okay. I know that feels easier to say than to do until live sometimes, but really It's okay and it's going to be okay, Especially if you're willing to learn and grow from it all. The key in these moments is not to shame or blame yourself. in fact, when they scan our brains, it's proven that shame shut down the centers of the brain that actually help you grow and change. so the more you shame and blame yourself, the less likely it will be that you'll be able to evolve and Learn and Grow from whatever is happening in your life. so, regardless of what it is that you're thinking about, or what it is you're dealing with, or what you're doing, you have an opportunity right now to change course. right now you can make a new choice. right now you can choose something different, Wherever you are right now. This is the starting point. If you ready to find the lesson, The real lesson, I bet you to close your eyes And place both hands over your heart And take a deep breath in through your nose, letting the breath fill up your chest, in your heart space, and hold it for a moment And then exhale through your mouth Again. deep inhale through your nose, filling up your heart, Hold it for just a moment, Exhale through your mouth. And now, for this last breath, we're going to do something a little bit different. you're going to inhale through your nose again and hold it, but when we exhale, I want you to close your mouth and make it tender, gentle, humming sound, that kind of sounds like this When you exhale, when you can let that humming sound last as long as you can. so I'm going to count us through it now. take a deep breath in, Hold it And then, with a hum, exhale: just tender and gentle. Let's actually do that one more time. just cuz it feels so good. go ahead and take a deep breath in, Hold it, Real, loving and tender and gentle. go ahead and exhale with that sound, Just feeling it vibrate in your heart. Now just breathe normally. You can feel free to keep your hands over your heart if it feels comfortable. I want you to start this practice by picturing yourself as a child. Any younger age will do so. just trust whatever comes up for you. I want you to try to visualize this younger version of yourself as best as you can. What is the child version of you? wearing Your shoes? look like? How old are you? as fit in our? do you like a couple different ages and whatever's coming up, or you just go with what comes first and trust it? What expression is on your face and it's vision? What body position are you in? Are you indoor? are you outdoor? incision, Is there anyone there with you as you imagine your younger self? Take a moment now to let this vision expand. If your mind starts to wander with your might, Remember to totally normal. just bring yourself back as gently as you drifted away from the vision. Wherever you are, you can always begin again, Right and left. that Vision expand, reading and whatever color is, insights and thoughts and things you can notice. Now i want you to invite into your fishing Any figure that makes that child version. if you feel safe, Can be a real person in your life, or even I'm fictional figure or someone you don't know or someone you look up to. it doesn't matter if it's realistic, but just bring in anyone. This child version of you feels completely at ease with NFP, sweat, Safeway, Anyone, any part of your life- teacher, a friend, a mentor, in someone from TV- anyone that makes you feel at peace, at ease and safe.

The practice is by yourself Coming back to the breast Whenever the mind wanders And remembering that the breath is always available to you to help bring you back into the present moment When you find your mind scattered and dispersed by the Russian busyness of your life. Always here, Home, Care, deep within you, a place of Stillness, the peace."
