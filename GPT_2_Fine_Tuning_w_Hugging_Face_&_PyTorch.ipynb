It is not meant to be read as anything beyond your normal physiological state of consciousness. This isn\\'t about yourself. I have suggested that there are some physical signs you should see to aid in the development of lucid dreaming.\\n1-3\\n1.1) A pleasant feeling during meditation. This is known as \"high energy\" relaxation.\\n1.2) Feeling relaxing. This is when you feel all of the sensations that cause your conscious being to vibrate and relax. It can be the most exciting or most relaxing experience of your life. It is usually one of the most challenging experiences for the individual as most of this can happen after just a few few minutes. If you are at all familiar with the concept, you have probably experienced a lot after seeing this:\\n1-3\\n3-4\\n1.3) Feeling relaxed. This is when the body feels no pressure or pain, rather rather like your consciousness trying to be normal.\\n1.4) Feeling not too bothered. This is during \"lunar calm.\" This is when the body feels no tension at all. However the body is able to feel it again or you might feel a certain relaxation.\\nThere are a few more sensations on this page:\\n1.5) Slight pressure. The feeling of pressure at the base of the neck or shoulders.\\n1.6) Slight pressure. This feeling of this feeling of relaxation is especially important during the moments when you are on a higher energy level and relaxed. This feeling is often felt at different times when the body is relaxed. At times this feeling may come from outside, other than when you are being in or near the body for about a few minutes and then at a specific time, when you are on a higher energy level, and when the body is still calm. For example:\\n1.7) Slight pressure when you are relaxing with a soft body. This will release the pressure or the tension of your lower abdomen or lower back while relaxing you body.\\n1.8) Slight pressure when you are in a relaxed position. This is a sense of relaxedness that does not create strain and can be especially relaxing for people with less body weight and some feeling of stress during relaxed states. It is also also important during relaxing states to get some peace at any point.\\n1.9)'"

I invite you to sit down if you like, or you could lay down whatever feels comfortable for you, and allow your eyes to close, but remain open to the sound of my voice as you continue to listen, begin to notice. maybe you become aware of a sound in your environment. that's completely normal. now you're going to begin to bring your attention to your breath. just notice\n",

I have been working in the factory for years now and in the mid-hour today, I will share with you the daily challenges. With every experience I experience, I understand that it is an opportunity for me to understand the difficulties and solutions to them. They will become difficult. They will hinder my business and I am willing to work for them. They will bring with them more difficulties than the difficulties you might find in a factory. They are always at your door, even when you cannot get in touch with them. Sometimes they will stop working and come back, without your knowledge. They will affect your work, your relationship, your life and your relationships, all your relationships. Sometimes they are very unpleasant, But it is okay if we don't like it. Sometimes we don't like it, But it is\n"

I know it can be really distracting, you know, especially with this quiet time that we have together right now, especially as we prepare for this practice. so, sitting up nice and tall- just lots of space to breathe in and out through the nose, make sure there are no distractions and just focus on your breathing. make a big, steady breath in through the nose, filling up the belly and the chest, and let the breath out, fall the shoulders back. I know that is a little challenging, but just keep your attention, your awareness, gently coming back to the sensations and the breath. this is your time to relax. right now. this is the time to be calm and centered. we want to be centered, we want to be balanced. right now, take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth.

This beach is magical and calming and you will Usually spend a couple of minutes getting lost in your thoughts and relaxing and then back to where you've just come from. if you are looking for more relaxing and positive meditations, you could also check out my other amazing affirmations video. Now that you have everything ready, go ahead and close your eyes and begin to imagine yourself walking towards the end of the beach and as you walk your hands towards the water, you notice that you notice that there's a backpack strapped to your shoulders. This is your nice and normal carry. wearing this backpack, you can let your kids pack up the things you need or just bring any stuff you need that you don't need anywhere in your house and then close that backpack and go ahead and pick up your bag. This is your backpack. This is your magic backpack. Now notice that your kids are also wearing this backpack and theyen't notice where they're carrying it when they go out, but they still carry it by. So you use that to haul and lock up the things that you need to carry around with you for a couple of minutes. Now just bring that backpack inside of you. as you put that backpack on the beach and imagine yourself walking towards the end of the beach. you're wearing your beautiful backpack now. put your big bag down in your trunk and in between those big shoulders are your shoulders. as you look at that, that's ransomware, isn't your shoulders, you. Now just feel the coolness of your shoulders and allow them to rest on the tops of your shoulders, to relax your arms. just feel that warmth of yours and then just carry that backpack out.

I want you now to imagine yourself in the middle of a beautiful, calming Beach, standing up now. in the middle of the beach there is a magic balloon. this is the magic balloon. imagine right now that you are right in the middle of this very beautiful beach and you feel your chest relaxing and your arms growing warmer. the balloon also comes into view and you look around and notice the sun has just risen, maybe a slight\n"
